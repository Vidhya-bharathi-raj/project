In this comprehensive project, I harnessed the power of Excel, a widely-used data analysis tool, to dissect and interpret Adidas US Sales data for 2020. The project is structured into four distinct worksheets within a single workbook:

### Worksheet 1:
Presents the original sales data, serving as the foundational dataset for the analysis.

### Worksheet 2:

### Worksheet 3:
Features **pivot tables** that crystallize data patterns, facilitating a deeper understanding of the sales figures.  

### Worksheet 4:
Deploys **dashboards** that vividly illustrate critical insights, including retailer-based unit sales, profitability by retailer, the most lucrative regions, city-wise unit sales, and product share contributions.
