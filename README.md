# [Vidhya Bharathi Raj's Project Portfolio](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC)
This portfolio contains four projects, each based on the skills used for analyzing data in the field of Data Analysis and other similar data-centric professions.

## [Adidas US Sales Analysis using Excel](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/Excel-Project)

In this comprehensive project, I harnessed the power of Excel, a widely-used data analysis tool, to dissect and interpret Adidas US Sales data for 2020. The project is structured into four distinct worksheets within a single workbook:

### Worksheet 1:
Presents the original sales data, serving as the foundational dataset for the analysis.

## [Mobiles Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/SQL-Project)

In this project, I employed SQL and MySQL to manipulate a CSV dataset of mobile data sourced from a public community. The project encompassed several stages:

### Data Definition and Data Transformation:
Utilized **DROP** statements to eliminate extraneous records, streamlining the dataset for clarity and simplicity. Renamed columns for more intuitive access and manipulation through SQL queries.

### Data Filtering and Sorting:
Applied SQL clauses like **SELECT**, **WHERE**, **ORDER BY**, and **LIKE** to extract vital information, enabling analyses such as:
- Identifying highly-rated mobiles with substantial rating counts.
- Locating the most expensive Apple mobiles.
- Discovering mobiles with terabyte storage in black color.
- Searching for mobiles with dual front cameras.
- Filtering mobiles within the price range of ₹10,000 to ₹20,000.

"This project demonstrated the robust capabilities of SQL in data cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying, leading to actionable insights."

## [Telcom Company Churn Analysis using Power BI](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/Power-BI-Project)

In this project, I utilized Power BI, a leading data visualization tool, to transform a CSV dataset into a compelling dashboard that provides clear insights. The project involved:

### Data Integration and Visualization:
Commenced with importing a comprehensive CSV dataset. Implemented **card** visuals for displaying key metrics such as customer count, phone service subscriptions, and total revenue.
### Demographic and Geographic Insights:
Utilized **clustered bar charts** for demographic analysis, including customer demographics, preferred payment methods, and internet service types.
Employed **map** visuals to illustrate the geographic distribution of customers. Created **funnel** visuals to depict the customer journey from acquisition to churn. Analyzed contract types with a **donut chart** to highlight prevalent contracts.
### In-Depth Churn Analysis:
Developed a **tree map** visual to provide a clear view of the primary reasons for customer churn, offering insights into customer needs and service gaps.
